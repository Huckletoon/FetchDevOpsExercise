# FetchDevOpsExercise

Hey Fetch!

To run this exercise, please run the file 'initiateServer.bat'. Provided Python 3 is installed on your machine, this should run the automation as specified in the exercise details.

A log file will be created in the same directory; if the automation completes successfully, it will log the instance DNS address that you may use to SSH into the newly created instance.

I've provided two additional .bat files to SSH into the instances as well, 'ssh_as_user1.bat' and 'ssh_as_user2.bat'. You will need to edit the files and add the instance DNS address at the end; after that, running the file should open a console window directly into the instance.
